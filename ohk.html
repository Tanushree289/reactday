<h1>
What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?
</h1>
<pre>
React is an open-source JS library for building the UIs for web applications; besides, React Native is used to build rich mobile UI from declarative components using only JavaScript. Both React and React Native are ruling the industry and are widely used for mobile and web applications.
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It's based on React, Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It deals with the views and lets you choose the rest of your front-end architecture. However, a strong library ecosystem has developed around it, allowing you to build a complete framework around React by adding a few libraries to it.

 Routing Implementation
</h1>
<pre>
 Adding React Router Components: The main Components of React Router are:

BrowserRouter: BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API(pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.
Routes: Itâ€™s a new component introduced in the v6 and a upgrade of the component. The main advantages of Routes over Switch are:
Relative s and s
Routes are chosen based on the best match instead of being traversed in order.
Route: Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.
Link: Link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like HTML anchor tag.
